ToxMail is a Tox node for the distributed Tox network - https://tox.im

ToxMail is a special Tox node that registers to the Tox DHT and runs:

- an SMTP service on the port of your choice (default is 2626)
- a Web Dashboard to manage the node on the port of your choice (default is 8080)
- an optional POP3 service on the port of your choice (default is 2727)

When you run a ToxMail node, you can exchange e-mails with your friends that also
have a ToxMail node running - using your regular e-mail desktop application.

ToxMail stores your e-mail in a local Maildir.
